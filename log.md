# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a new angular component and set up a new route. Started
adding in unit tests for components. Began getting back into python by writing a
simple client and server.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with sending params to an angular component with ui-router. I want to eventually switch to a version of ui-router that lets me pass in my component instead of a template. Setting up testing for my app was the real problem. I am still trying to figure out the best way to setup my project for unit testing with Karma, Jasmine, and Webpack. Today I also began getting back into python. I started by writing a simple client and server program. I want to eventually make a web scraper using python so I will continue learning more python on the side.

### Day 2: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning python by creating a simple socket echo
server and began writing a simple socket http server.

**Thoughts:** Ran into problems connecting the browser to my simple http server but curl worked fine. Need to figure out what is blocking the browser connection.

### Day 3: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Unboxed my rasberry pi 3 and set it up. Continued fixing
up my simple socket server in python and started writing a simple web crawler.

**Thoughts:** Spent too much time fixing some basic python syntax to get my socket server and web crawler running. It's been a long time since I last used python so I am going to go back and relearn the basics. Looking forward to making something with python or node on my rasbperry pi.

### Day 4: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started looking through the node dominos pizza api. Began
testing out code on my raspberry pi for ordering pizza.

**Thoughts:** Dominos garlic parmesian sauce(white sauce) is the bomb.
