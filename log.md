# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a new angular component and set up a new route. Started
adding in unit tests for components. Began getting back into python by writing a
simple client and server.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with sending params to an angular component with ui-router. I want to eventually switch to a version of ui-router that lets me pass in my component instead of a template. Setting up testing for my app was the real problem. I am still trying to figure out the best way to setup my project for unit testing with Karma, Jasmine, and Webpack. Today I also began getting back into python. I started by writing a simple client and server program. I want to eventually make a web scraper using python so I will continue learning more python on the side.

### Day 0: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning python by creating a simple socket echo
server and began writing a simple socket http server.

**Thoughts:** Ran into problems connecting the browser to my simple http server but curl worked fine. Need to figure out what is blocking the browser connection.
